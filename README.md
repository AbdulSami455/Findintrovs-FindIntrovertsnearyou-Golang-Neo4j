# Find Introvs - Introvert  Matching Platform
Welcome to the Introvert Preferences Matching Platform! This project is designed to create a personalized, introvert-friendly environment where users can connect with like-minded individuals based on their hobbies, preferences, and activities. Using Neo4j as the database and Gin framework for API development, the platform focuses on meaningful connections by matching users based on shared interests.
